we have a dataset for brute force attack detection
our dataset is a .csv file

this dataset consist of more than 500000 row !

the exsiting labels are :
	1)Benign
	2)FTP-Brute Force
	3)SSH-Brute Force
	
We want to do classification on this dataset using one of the machine learning algorithms.


Our algorithm of choice here is "Support Vector Machine (SVM)".
